            <h5> First thing you have to is to make out 10 tasks for the user to do on your website, here are a few
                examples</h5>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Go and search for a product on this page</li>
                <li>Go to put an item into the cart</li>
                <li>Go to contact customer support about a return</li>
            </ul>
            <p> When deciding your task, you should make these so they suit what a typical user journey would be like
                on your website, this is dependant on business goals also. </p>

    <div class="row ">
        <div class="col-md-6 offset-md-3">
            <h5>Next thing to do is make out a list of questions ready to be asked while the user is going through the
                tasks.<br> Not all
                questions will need to be asked for each task so keeping the list of questions small is key to
                remembering which
                ones to ask for each task. Some examples:</h5>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>What is your initial impression on the page and would you find it trust worthy and why?</li>
                <li> Where would you expect to find more information on this item</li>
                <li>What motivated you to click (specific element) or what would you click next?</li>
                <li>How long did it take the user to complete a task?</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The key to these questions is to observe the participant so if you think they look confused or
                if they are taking a long time to complete a task then take a note
                and ask them after they complete the tasks, why they took so long at a certain point. Try to keep the
                user flowing through the tasks as much as possible as if they were actually browsing your website.</p>

                used to see if anything stood out for them over the course of the tasks and to see their thoughts or
                suggestions.
                A few examples might be:</h5>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Was there anything that stood out for you from this page?</li>

                <li>Why did (certain task) take x amount of time to complete?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is a great chance to ask them for any suggestions without putting them under pressure.
                You might get some useful information on why they took so long on one part.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The tester reads out the task to the user one at a time.</li>
                <li>After each task, ask them if they expected what they just saw, as per the question.</li>
                <li>Ask the user to think out loud throughout the test, this can be really beneficial into getting an
                    insight into if your
                    website is laid out as expected
                </li>
                <li>If you are struggling to write down all comments, make a note and you can come back to it after or;
                    ideally have someone
                    else around to take notes during the usability test while you observe.
                </li>

                <li>Let the user do as much as they can but you can give them guidance if they get stuck, but be sure to
                    note, this
                    may be a fault in the UI and UX of the website

                test.</h5>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to get someone that does not have previous experience using the part of the website you are
                    testing.
                </li>
                <li>Do not try to recruit only people that you think might use your product, you are
                    not letting other people who might have different expectations to give their view and you might lose
                    a customer. But of course letting the target audience test it is vital.
                </li>
                <li>Don't get bogged down on the questions, think of them more as guidance on types of questions that
                    can be asked throughout the test, let the user talk out loud and you will get valuable insights from them.
                </li>
                <li>Make sure to study the results of the usability test after and also study how you performed also for
                    future.
